Given an array of unique elements, return all possible subsequences.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

For example: 

```typescript
type A = Subsequence<[1, 2] // [] | [1] | [2] | [1, 2]
```
