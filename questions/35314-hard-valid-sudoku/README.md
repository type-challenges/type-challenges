Sudoku is a famous paper and pencil game. The goal of Sudoku is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers so that each row, column and 3x3 section contain all of the digits between 1 and 9. You'll be given a finished 9x9 grid, and you need to determine if it's a valid Sudoku solution. Return true if it is, and false if it is not.

```ts
type Matrix = [
  [9, 5, 7, 8, 4, 6, 1, 3, 2],
  [2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 1, 6, 7, 8],
  [1, 8, 6, 7, 3, 2, 5, 4, 9],
  [8, 9, 1, 6, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7],
  [3, 4, 5, 9, 7, 8, 2, 6, 1],
  [6, 7, 2, 1, 5, 4, 8, 9, 3],
  [4, 6, 8, 3, 1, 9, 7, 2, 5],
  [5, 2, 3, 4, 8, 7, 9, 1, 6],
  [7, 1, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 8, 4]
]
type result = ValidSudoku <Matrix>; // expected to be true
```
