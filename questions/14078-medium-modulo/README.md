Javascript and a lot of other programming languages support the modulo (also know as remainder) operator `%` which returns the remainder when an integer is divided by another integer. For Javascript's implementation - see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Remainder.

Here's some examples:

```js
5 % 4 === 1     // Since 5 divided by 4 is 1 with a remainder of 1
9 % 4 === 1     // Since 9 divided by 4 is 2 with a remainder of 1
16 % 2 === 0    // Since 16 divided by 4 is 8 with a remainder of 0
```

You do not need to worry about the case when the left or right hand sides are negative.
